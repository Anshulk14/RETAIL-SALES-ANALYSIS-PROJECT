## Project Overview  
The project focuses on:  
- Creating a structured `retail_sales` table.  
- Cleaning data to handle missing values and duplicates.  
- Running SQL queries for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Key Features  
1. **Table Creation:**  
   - Defines fields such as Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount.  

2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Identifies and handles missing or null values.  
   - Checks for duplicate transactions.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
   - Previews the dataset with `SELECT` queries.  
   - Fetches column information using `information_schema`.  
   - Counts records and aggregates data.

## How to Use  
1. Run the `CREATE TABLE` script to set up the `retail_sales` table.  
2. Use the provided SQL queries for data cleaning and analysis.  
3. Modify or expand queries to gain deeper insights.
